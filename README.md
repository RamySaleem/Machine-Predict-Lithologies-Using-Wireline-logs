# Machine Predict Lithologies Using Wireline logs
Identifying subsurface lithologies or rock types is essential for all geoscientists in order to explore our subsurface resources, particularly in the oil and gas industry. Lithology refers to the type of rock that forms the subsurface, and it is classified into, for instance, sandstone, claystone, marl, limestone, and dolomite. Several subsurface data can be used to identify lithologies, such as wireline logs petrophysical data. However, it is often a tedious, repetitive and time-consuming task. This project will predict lithology from petrophysical logs using machine learning techniques (classification) and add to the solution of these problems since these logs are direct proxies of lithology.
